l_code_NULL=2000
l_original_NULL=Column "{0}" is a empty cell, or current column can not use "null".
l_cause_NULL=In the table-based sections (protein, peptide, and small molecule) there MUST NOT be any empty cells. In case a given property is not available "null" MUST be used. Notice: some properties not allow "null" value, for example unit_id, accession and so on. This is, for example, the case when modifications were not identified on a given peptide (i.e. the table cell MUST NOT be empty but “null” has to be reported).

l_code_NotNULL=2001
l_original_NotNULL=Column "{0}" field value "{1}" not allow "null" value.
l_cause_NotNULL=Some kind of field value can not allow "null" or empty value. For example accession, unitId and so on.

l_code_LineOrder=2100
l_original_LineOrder=current line belong to "{0}" section, can not display here.
l_cause_LineOrder=mzTab line including four mainly sections: metadata, protein, peptide, small molecule. Every section in an mzTab file MUST only occur once if present. Therefore, proteins, for example, from multiple UNITs (i.e. experiments) MUST be reported in the same protein section / table. If the Peptide and Protein Section are present, the information MUST be consistent between both sections. The line order like following: metadata lines should be display first, then the protein header, protein; peptide header, peptide, small molecule header, small molecule. 

l_code_HeaderLine=2101
l_original_HeaderLine=header line "{0}" only occur once!
l_cause_HeaderLine=Each table based section (protein, peptide, small molecule) MUST start with the corresponding header line. These header lines MUST only occur once in the document since each section also MUST only occur once.

l_code_NoHeaderLine=2102
l_original_NoHeaderLine=current line "{0}" is data line, according header line not defined yet.
l_cause_NoHeaderLine=Each table based section (protein, peptide, small molecule) MUST start with the corresponding header line. These header lines MUST only occur once in the document since each section also MUST only occur once.

l_code_Duplication=2103
l_original_Duplication="{0}" duplicate with the previous lines.
l_cause_Duplication=Duplication MUST be prevented when merging mzTab files.

l_code_UnitID=2104
l_original_UnitID=The unitId "{0}" not exists in the metadata. 
l_cause_UnitID=The unitId not exists in the metadata. During validate ColUnit columns, data in the protein/peptide/small_molecular table, the unit should be defined in the metadata. 

l_code_ColUnit=2105
l_original_ColUnit=ColUnit "{0}" column name "{1}" can not find in section stable column.
l_cause_ColUnit=Defines the used unit for a column in the protein/peptide/small_molecule section. The define label format like {UNIT_ID}-colunit-{protein/peptide/small_molecule}. The value label format like {column name}={Parameter defining the unit}. If {column name} can not found in the section stable columns, report warn message.

l_code_PeptideAccession=2106
l_original_PeptideAccession=Column "{0}" value in the peptide table "{1}" not found in the protein table.
l_cause_PeptideAccession=Peptide accession MAY display in the protein table. 

l_code_DuplicationAccession=2107
l_original_DuplicationAccession=Column "{0}" value "{1}" duplicate in the unit "{2}"
l_cause_DuplicationAccession=A protein accession MUST be unique within one UNIT. Together with the UNIT_ID the accession creates a unique identifier within a given mzTab file.

l_code_ProteinCoverage=2108
l_original_ProteinCoverage=Column "{0}" value "{1}" should between 0 and 1. 
l_cause_ProteinCoverage=A value between 0 and 1 defining the protein coverage


l_code_IdNumber=2109
l_original_IdNumber="{0}" defined multiple member are numbered should be 1..n
l_cause_IdNumber=In mztab, multiple members are numbered 1..n, for example: Multiple instruments are numbered PRIDE_1234-instrument[1], PRIDE_1234-instrument[2]


l_code_ModificationPosition=2110
l_original_ModificationPosition=Column "{0}" include modification "{1}", its position not between 0 and size + 1.
l_cause_ModificationPosition=Terminal modifications MUST be reported at position 0 or protein size + 1 respectively.


l_code_CHEMMODS=2111
l_original_CHEMMODS=Column "{0}" value "{1}" can not used here.
l_cause_CHEMMODS=For proteins and peptides modifications SHOULD be reported using either UNIMOD or PSI-MOD accessions. As these two ontologies are not applicable to small molecules, so-called CHEMMODs can also be defined. CHEMMODs MUST NOT be used if the modification can be reported using a PSI-MOD or UNIMOD accession.  Mass deltas MUST NOT be used for CHEMMODs if the delta can be expressed through a known chemical formula.


l_code_SubstituteIdentifier=2112
l_original_SubstituteIdentifier=Column "{0}" value "{1}" is not a amino acid sequence.
l_cause_SubstituteIdentifier=It is possible to report substitutions of amino acids using SUBST:{amino acid}. In these cases, the “sequence” column MUST contain the original, unaltered sequence. 

l_code_CVParamOptionalColumn=2113
l_original_CVParamOptionalColumn=Optional CV param column "{0}" need data type "{1}, but "{2}" data not match.
l_cause_CVParamOptionalColumn=check cv param optional column definition matched to data type. For example: opt_cv_MS:1001905_emPAI_value, MS:1001905 definition	The emPAI value of protein abundance, produced from the emPAI algorithm, and value-type:xsd:double.

l_code_AbundanceColumnId=2114
l_original_AbundanceColumnId="{0}" column value "{1}" sub id number not defined in the metadata.
l_cause_AbundanceColumnId=Abundance column sub[id] number should be defined in the metadata.

l_code_AbundanceColumnSameId=2115
l_original_AbundanceColumnSameId="{0}", "{1}", "{2}" column sub id number not same.
l_cause_AbundanceColumnSameId=Abundance, Abundance_stdev, Abundance_std_error should have same sub[id] number.

l_code_Software=2116
l_original_Software=software parameter "{0}" not contain version information.
l_cause_Software=The parameter's value SHOULD contain the software's version. The order (numbering) should reflect the order in which the tools were used.
