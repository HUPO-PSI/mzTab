= Introduction =

The mzTab file format is meant as a simple, text based, tab-delimited file format to report proteomics _results_. It is not meant as a replacement for the PSI standard formats such as mzIdentML or mzQuantML but as an addition.

= Format Specification =

The mzTab format is not yet stable. Therefore, the current version of the format specification can be found in the word document [http://mztab.googlecode.com/svn/specification/trunk/specification-document/mzTab%20format%20specification.doc mzTab format specification.doc].
