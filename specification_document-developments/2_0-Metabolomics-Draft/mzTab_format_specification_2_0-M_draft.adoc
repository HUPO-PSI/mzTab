== Abstract

The  Metabolomics Standards initiative (MSI) and the Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) define community standards for data representation in proteomics/metabolomics to facilitate data comparison, exchange and verification. In this context, the two organizations are working together on a shared standard for downstream results, following mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. This document defines a tab-delimited text file format to report metabolomics results, based on a shared core mzTab format, also used in the proteomics context.

[[background]]
=== Background

This document addresses the systematic description of small molecule identification and quantification data retrieved from mass spectrometry (MS)-based experiments. A large number of software tools are available that analyze MS data and produce a variety of different output data formats.

mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is also intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to share and combine basic information.

mzTab has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks (more specific use cases are provided in <<use-cases-for-mztab>>):

1.  _Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results,_ especially with researchers outside the field of metabolomics.
2.  _Export of results to external software,_ including programs such as Microsoft Excel^®^ and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R.
3.  _Act as an output format of (web-) services_ that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages.
4.  _Be able to link to the external experimental evidence_ e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.

This document presents a specification, not a tutorial. As such, the presentation of technical details is deliberately direct. The role of the text is to describe the model and justify design decisions made. The document does not discuss how the models should be used in practice, consider tool support for data capture or storage, or provide comprehensive examples of the models in use. It is anticipated that tutorial material will be developed independently of this specification.

[[use-cases-for-mztab]]
== Use Cases for mzTab

The following cases of usage have driven the development of the mzTab data model, and are used to define the scope of the format in version 2.0.0.

1. mzTab-M files should be simple enough to make metabolomics results accessible to people outside the respective fields. This should facilitate the sharing of data beyond the borders of the fields and make it accessible to non-experts.

2. mzTab-M files should contain sufficient information to provide an electronic summary of all findings in a metabolomics study to permit its use as a standard documentation format for ‘supplementary material’ sections of publications in metabolomics. It should thus be able to replace PDF tables as a way of reporting small molecules and make published identification and quantification information more accessible.

3. mzTab-M files should enable reporting at different levels of detail: ranging from a simple summary of the final results to a detailed reporting including the experimental design.

4. It should be possible to open mzTab-M files with “standard” software such as Microsoft Excel^®^ or Open Office Spreadsheet. This should furthermore improve the usability of the format to people outside the fields of metabolomics.

5. mzTab files should make MS-derived results easily accessible to scripting languages allowing bioinformaticians to develop software without the overhead of developing sophisticated parsing code. Since mzTab files will be comparatively small, the data from multiple experiments can be processed at once without requiring special resource management techniques.

6. It should be possible to contain the complete final results of an MS-based metabolomics experiment in a single file, with the exception that different ionisation modes SHOULD be captured in different files (see <<support-for-positive-and-negative-modes>>). This should furthermore reduce the complexity of sharing and processing an experiment’s final results.

7. It should be useful as an output format by web-services that can then be readily accessed by tools supporting mzTab-M.

8. It should be possible to directly link a small molecule record to its source spectrum in an external MS data file.


[[notational-conventions]]
== Notational Conventions

The key words “MUST,” “MUST NOT,” “REQUIRED,” “SHALL,” “SHALL NOT,” “SHOULD,” “SHOULD NOT,” “RECOMMENDED,” “MAY,” and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 <<bradner-1997, (Bradner 1997)>>.

[[relationship-to-other-specifications]]
== Relationship to Other Specifications

The specification described in this document has not been developed in isolation; indeed, it is designed to be complementary to, and thus used in conjunction with, several existing and emerging models. Related specifications include the following:

1.  _mzML_ (http://www.psidev.info/mzml). mzML is the PSI standard for capturing mass spectra / peak lists resulting from mass spectrometry in proteomics <<martens-2011, (Martens _et al._ 2011)>>. mzTab files MAY be used in conjunction with mzML, although it will be possible to use mzTab with other formats of mass spectra. This document does not assume familiarity with mzML.
2.  __ISA-TAB (__http://isa-tools.org/_)._ The ISA framework allows for reporting experimental metadata and study designs in considerable detail, and is already used for describing metabolomics experiments. It is expected that mzTab files may be linked to ISA-TAB formatted files, for cases where a rich experimental design is to be captured. The linkage between mzTab-M and ISA-TAB is further exemplified in section <<referencing-external-resources>>.

[[relationship-to-mztab-1.0]]
=== Relationship to mzTab 1.0

The first stable version of mzTab (version 1.0) was developed primarily by the PSI as a format for the final results (identification or quantification) of a proteomics experiment, using MS. In mzTab version 1.0 limited support was included for metabolomics, through a small molecule table, in which end results could be encoded at the level of quantified metabolites. The intention of mzTab-M is to extend these concepts, so that more detail can be captured about the evidence trail for quantification, including MS features (different charge states or adducts) and the evidence trail for identifications - both of which could not be easily supported in mzTab v 1.0. mzTab-M is not formally backwards compatible, but follows a similar design pattern. Design decisions made in mzTab-M may in the future be adopted for a version of mzTab specifically intended for proteomics only, but at the time of writing mzTab version 1.0 remains in active use for proteomics, but is deprecated for use in metabolomics.


[[the-psi-mass-spectrometry-controlled-vocabulary-cv]]
=== The PSI Mass Spectrometry Controlled Vocabulary (CV)

The PSI-MS controlled vocabulary is intended to provide terms for annotation of mass spectrometry-related file formats. The CV has been generated with a collection of terms from software vendors and academic groups working in the area of mass spectrometry and MS informatics. Some terms describe attributes that must be coupled with a numerical value attribute in the CvParam element (e.g. MS:1000028 “detector resolution”) and optionally a unit for that value (e.g. MS:1001117, “theoretical mass”, units = “dalton”). The terms that require a value are denoted by having a “datatype” key-value pair in the CV itself: MS:1000511 "ms level" value-type:xsd:int. Terms that need to be qualified with units are denoted with a “has_units” key in the CV itself (relationship: has_units: UO:0000221 ! dalton).

As recommended by the PSI CV guidelines, psi-ms.obo should be dynamically maintained via the psidev-ms-vocab@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list that allows any user to request new terms in agreement with the community involved. Once a consensus is reached among the community the new terms are added within a few business days. If there is no obvious consensus, the CV coordinators committee should vote and make a decision. A new psi-ms.obo should then be released by updating the file on the GitHub server without changing the name of the file.

The following ontologies or controlled vocabularies specified below may also be suitable or required in certain instances:

* Unit Ontology (http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/uo.html)
* ChEBI (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chebi/ontology/chebi.obo)
* OBI Ontology of Biological Investigations (http://obi-ontology.org/)
* NCBITaxon UniProt Taxonomy Database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncbitaxon)
* BRENDA tissue/ enzyme source (http://www.brenda-enzymes.info/ontology/tissue/tree/update/update_files/BrendaTissueOBO).
* Cell Type ontology (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/master/cl-basic.obo).

[[resolved-design-and-scope-issues]]
== Resolved Design and scope issues

There were several issues regarding the design of the format that were not clear cut, and a design choice was made that was not completely agreeable to everyone. So that these issues are not continously revisited, we document the issues here and why the decision that is implemented was made.

[[use-of-identifiers-for-input-spectra-to-a-search]]
=== Use of identifiers for input spectra to a search

Small molecules MUST be linked to an identifier of the source spectrum (in an external file) from which the identifications are made by way of a reference in the `spectra_ref` attribute and via the `ms_run` element which stores the URI of the file in the `location` attribute.

It is advantageous if there is a consistent system for identifying spectra in different file formats. The following table is implemented in the PSI-MS CV for providing consistent identifiers for different spectrum file formats.

NOTE: This table shows examples from the CV but MAY be extended. The CV holds the definite specification for legal encodings of spectrum identifier values.

[[table-1, CV Terms and Rules]]
.Controlled vocabulary terms and rules implemented in the PSI-MS CV for formulating the “nativeID” to identify spectra in different file formats.
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|*ID* |*Term* |*Data type* |*Comment*
|MS:1000768 |Thermo nativeID format |controllerType=xsd:nonNegativeInteger controllerNumber=xsd:positiveInteger scan=xsd:positiveInteger. |controller=0 is usually the mass spectrometer
|MS:1000769 |Waters nativeID format |function=xsd:positiveInteger process=xsd:nonNegativeInteger scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |

|MS:1000772 |Bruker BAF nativeID format |scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |
|MS:1000773 |Bruker FID nativeID format |file=xsd:IDREF |The nativeID must be the same as the source file ID
|MS:1000774 |multiple peak list nativeID format |index=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for referencing peak list files with multiple spectra, i.e. MGF, PKL, merged DTA files. Index is the spectrum number in the file, starting from 0.
|MS:1000775 |single peak list nativeID format |file=xsd:IDREF |The nativeID must be the same as the source file ID. Used for referencing peak list files with one spectrum per file, typically in a folder of PKL or DTAs, where each sourceFileRef is different
|MS:1000776 |scan number only nativeID format |scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for conversion from mzXML, or a DTA folder where native scan numbers can be derived.
|MS:1000777 |spectrum identifier nativeID format |spectrum=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for conversion from mzData. The spectrum id attribute is referenced.
|MS:1001530 |mzML unique identifier |xsd:string |Used for referencing mzML. The value of the spectrum id attribute is referenced directly.
|===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

In mzTab, the spectra_ref attribute should be constructed following the data type specification in <<table-1>>. As an example, to reference the third spectrum (index = 2) in an MGF (Mascot Generic Format) file:

----
MTD ms_run[1]-format [MS, MS:1001062, Mascot MGF file, ]

MTD ms_run[1]-id_format [MS, MS:1000774, multiple peak list nativeID format, ]

...

SEH ... spectra_ref ...

SME ... ms_run[1]:index=2 ...
----

Example: Reference the spectrum with identifier “scan=11665” in an mzML file.

----
MTD ms_run[1]-format [MS, MS:1000584, mzML file, ]

MTD ms_run[1]-id_format [MS, MS:1001530, mzML unique identifier, ]

[[recommendations-for-reporting-replicates-within-experimental-designs]]
=== Recommendations for reporting replicates within experimental designs

Modeling the correct reporting of technical/biological replicates within experimental designs is supported in mzTab as shown in Figure 1. The following components have various cross-references and MUST be used in different types of mzTab files as follows:

* _study_variable_ – The variables about which the final results of a study are reported, which may have been derived following averaging across a group of replicate measurements (assays). The same concept has been defined by others as “experimental factor”.
* _ms_run_ – An MS run is effectively one run on an MS instrument, and is referenced from assay in different contexts. In the case of pre-fractionation into _n_ fractions, an assay SHOULD reference _n_ ms_runs.
* _assay_ – The application of a measurement about the sample (in this case through MS) – producing values about small molecules or lipids. One assay is typically mapped to one MS run in the case of label-free MS analysis (with no pre-fractionation). At the present time, multiplexing within an ms_run is not supported in mzTab-M, thus there would typically be a one:one relationship between assay and ms_run.
* _sample_ – a biological material that has been analyzed, to which descriptors of species, cell/tissue type etc. can be attached. In all of types of mzTab file, these MAY be reported in the metadata section as sample[1-n]-description. Samples are NOT MANDATORY in mzTab, since many software packages cannot determine what type of sample was analyzed (e.g. whether biological or technical replication was performed). If the file producer wishes to describe whether biological or technical replication has been performed, then sample elements SHOULD be provided.


Clear definitions of biological and technical replicates are difficult to provide as these are somewhat dependent upon the biological domain. However, we use the following general definitions in mzTab.

* Biological replicates are where different samples have been analyzed by MS.
* Technical replicates are where same samples are analyzed multiple times by MS.

NOTE: There is deliberately no attempt to define the boundary of the term “sample”.

If sample level information is provided optimally, it is expected that:

* _n_ biological replicates can be mapped to sample[1-n]
* _m_ technical replicate measurements of sample 1 SHOULD be mapped to assay[1-m] referencing sample[1] (for example).

However, an open challenge remains since some analysis software is often not aware of whether replicates (multiple MS runs) are originally biological or technical in nature. As such, the default behavior for mzTab exporters from quantitative software is to exclude sample level information and report quantitative data for assay[1-n] and study_variable[1-n].

Additional annotation software would typically be required to add the sample-level information, as provided (often manually) by the user.


[#figurerrr-1]
image::img/media/figure1.png[image, title="Simple experimental designs in mzTab can be represented using a combination of study_variable (SV), assay, ms_run and sample. Quantitative values can be reported in files for SVs and assays. A) SV is intended to capture different groups of replicates, which might have resulted from different sample types e.g. control versus treated (as 2 SVs), n time points over a treatment course (as n SVs). Nested designs can be captured by annotation of additional CV terms onto SVs. B) assay captures a measurement made about a molecule (small molecule/lipid) where multiple assays within the same group are taken to be replicates of some kind (biological or technical). Additional details about the sample processing to generate an assay should not be captured in mzTab, but could be captured via a reference to an external suitable format such as ISA-TAB. C) ms_run captures a single run on an MS instrument. If pre-fractionation has been performed then an assay can reference to multiple ms_runs. In this case, ms_run can have a nested structure enabling assay to reference to a group of MS files. D) samples are optional in mzTab since the quantitative software may often be unaware of the biological samples that have been analysed.",width=100%,pdfwidth=100%]




[[reporting-derivatization-approaches]]
=== Reporting derivatization approaches

For GC and HPLC, derivatization is often applied in order to specifically target compounds that are otherwise hard to measure at all, being non-volatile or otherwise chemically / physically poorly suited for the separation method and to increase ionization eﬃciency and selectivity for subsequent MS analysis. For GC, the primary derivatization methods are:

* acylation
* alkylation and esterification
* silylation

In mzTab-M, any derivatization agents used should be reported in the metadata section under derivatization_agent[1-n]. It is expected that in the small molecule evidence table where matches are made to database entries including the derivatized form, then that form SHOULD be reported in evidence row. In the small molecule (summary) table, it MAY be appropriate to reference a database entry for the actual molecule inferred without the derivatization addition, although this is context dependent and in some cases it may be more appropriate to reference a database entry for the derivatized form.



[[encoding-missing-values-zeroes-nulls-infinity-and-calculation-errors]]
=== Encoding missing values, zeroes, nulls, infinity and calculation errors

In the table-based sections there MUST NOT be any empty cells. In case a given property is not available “null” MUST be used, but this is only allowed for parameters with "is nullable=True".

For numerical values, they MUST be encoded following the specifications of https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal[xs:decimal]. This does not natively support NaN, INF, scientific notation or null. As such, it is allowed in mzTab to include "NaN" for incalculable numbers and "null" for no data. In some cases, there is ambiguity with respect to the use of "0" versus "null": e.g. if there are alignment issues and it is unclear whether a molecule has been quantified with zero abundance or the feature was potentially present in the data but was not found. Export software would be expected to make a decision on this cases, based on best understanding of the case in hand.

Scientific notation and infinity is explicitly not supported.


[[support-for-positive-and-negative-modes]]
=== Support for positive and negative modes

It is common in metabolomics workflows to use both positive and negative ionisation modes to increase coverage of molecules quantified. In general, an mzTab-M file is intended to capture a data set generated from assays have been aligned (e.g. in the retention time dimension) to produce a coherent data matrix with few missing values. To our knowledge, it is not common to compare directly the results from positive and negative modes in the same data matrix. As such, we anticipate that such results (i.e. positive mode and negative mode) should be encoded in two different mzTab-M files.

[[referencing-evidence-for-small-molecule-identifications]]
=== Referencing evidence for small molecule identifications

Evidence for small molecule identification is captured by reference from the SML table via features (SMFs) down to the final table - Small Molecule Evidence elements. It is possible to have a legal mzTab-M file that does not contain any features (SML summary level only). In this case, detailed information about small molecule evidence cannot be provided. It is generally RECOMMENDED to include data at the SML, SMF and SME levels.

SMF elements should reference down to all evidence elements (SME rows) that support the identification of that particular feature.

If features (SMF elements) have been grouped prior to evidence collation, then different groups SMF elements SHOULD reference the same SME elements redundantly.

[[figure-2]]
image::img/media/figure2.png[image,width=100%,pdfwidth=100%, title=" A) The summary level (SML) reports the final assumed identification, allowing for ambiguity by “|” separated results in the relevant columns; B) The feature level (SMF) does not explicitly report identifications but references down to the SME level. Ambiguity is propagated via referencing multiple SME elements (rows) with different identification results; C) One SME element (one row) represents a single possible identification from some input evidence. Multiple identifications from the same input data share the same value for evidence_input_id. Ambiguity is captured by different rows for the same input data."]

[[ambiguity_in_identification]]
=== Ambiguity in identification
It is common in metabolomics and lipidomics for significant ambiguity to remain after data processing in the identification of molecules. In the top level (SML) table, multiple identifiers MAY be provided in several columns: database_identifier, chemical_formula, smiles, inchi, chemical_name and uri. If there is ambiguity in the actual identity of the molecule, multiple identifiers SHOULD be reported separated by the "|" character. The number of elements separated by | characters MUST be identical in all columns where data is reported to emphasize the correspondence across columns.

The SML element <<reliability>> MUST be assigned a value to indicate the confidence or ambiguity of the overall assignment.

When referencing from the features (SMF) elements to evidence (SME) elements, it is possible for a SMF element to reference multiple SME elements. However, there are potentially several reasons for a 1 to many relationship. A different code MUST be provided in the SME_ID_REF_ambiguity_code element to clarify the case:

* The same input data (e.g. fragment spectrum or isotopic profile) has multiple results, supporting _different_ potential identifications i.e. where ambiguity remains (code=1)
* Different input data (or different searches of the same data) have returned results evidence supporting the _same_ identification i.e. no ambiguity remains (code=2).
* Different input data has been used to support identification and ambiguity still remains (code=3).

[[ambiguity_in_lipidomics]]
=== Ambiguity in lipidomics identification
The mzTab-M 2.0.0 release is intended to be used for capturing profiling studies from both metabolomics and lipidomics. However, it is acknowledged that representing ambiguity in the identification of lipid molecules, based on the available evidence from MS is potentially more complicated than for small molecules. As such, mzTab-M 2.0.0 SHOULD be used on release for representing lipid-based data, but a working group will continue to improve on the mechanism for representing lipid identification data, for example defining particular CV terms to be used in the appropriate places of the standard. These artefacts will be reported in due course and should plug-in to this version in a backwards-compatible manner.

[[guidelines-for-reporting-results-prior-to-or-with-no-alignment-step-across-features]]
=== Guidelines for reporting results prior to or with no alignment step across features

The most common intended use for mzTab-M is to encode MS results that have been aligned across multiple analyses (assays), for example by retention time alignment in LC-MS or GC-MS approaches. However, it is possible to use mzTab-M as part of internal pipelines to represent small molecules quantified by MS (features) before alignment. The RECOMMENDED encoding for doing this would be to represent the features from _n_ MS analyes in _n_ mzTab files, rather than attempting to create an SMF table including a sparse matrix filled with nulls for all but one of the assay columns.

[[Guidelines-for-pre-fractionation]]
=== Guidelines for workflows involving pre-fractionation
It is possible that a single analysis of a sample is split offline via some fractionation technology prior to LC/GC-MS into _n_ MS analyses to limit the complexity of the molecules arriving at the detector. Such workflows, while relatively rare in metabolomics, can be encoded in mzTab-M via an assay referencing to _n_ ms_runs. It may be desirable to maintain the link from a feature (SMF row) to the ms_run from which it was obtained. This SHOULD be achieved through the use of an optional column called "opt_global_ms_run_refs", in which the identifiers of ms_runs are placed where the feature has been quantified from.


[[adding-optional-columns]]
=== Adding optional columns

Additional columns MAY be added to the end of rows in all the table-based sections.

These column headers MUST start with the prefix “opt_” followed by the identifier of the object they reference: assay, study variable, MS run or “global” (if the value relates to all replicates). Column names MUST only contain the following characters: ‘A’-‘Z’, ‘a’-‘z’, ‘0’-‘9’, ‘_’, ‘-’, ‘[’, ‘]’, and ‘:’. CV parameter accessions MAY be used for optional columns following the format: opt_\{OBJECT_ID}_cv_\{accession}_\{parameter name}. Spaces within the parameter’s name MUST be replaced by ‘_’.

The information stored within an optional column is completely up to the resource that generates the file. It MUST not be assumed that optional columns having the same name in different mzTab files contain the same type of information. CV parameter accessions MAY be used as optional column names according to the following convention: opt_\{OBJECT_ID}_cv_\{accession}_\{parameter name}. Spaces within the parameter’s name MUST be replaced by ‘_’.

[[referencing-external-resources]]
=== Referencing external resources

The current specifications of mzTab-M only support relatively simple details about sample preparation and experimental design. Users may wish to use ISA-TAB to record more details about these aspects. The ISA-TAB file can be referenced by the external_study_uri attribute.

Generally, any external resource reference (suffixed `-uri`, or `-location`) must be provided as a valid URI string. This allows to report local, as well as remote resource links (URLs) and unique unified resource names (URNs).

[[format-specification]]
== Format specification

This section describes the structure of an mzTab file.

* *Field separator* +
The column delimiter is the Unicode Horizontal Tab character (Unicode codepoint 0009).
* *File encoding* +
The UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set is the preferred encoding for mzTab files. However, parsers should be able to recognize commonly used encodings.
* *Case sensitivity* +
All column labels and field names are case-sensitive.
* *Line prefix* +
Every line in an mzTab file MUST start with a three letter code identifying the type of line delimited by a Tab character. The three letter codes are as follows:
** `MTD` for metadata
** `SMH` for small molecule table header line (the column labels)
** `SML` for rows of the small molecule table
** `SFH` for small molecule feature header line
** `SMF` for rows of the small molecule feature table
** `SHE` for small molecule evidence header line
** `SME` for rows of the small molecule evidence table
** `COM` for comment lines

* *Header lines* +
Each table based section (small molecule, small molecule feature and small molecule evidence) MUST start with the corresponding header line. These header lines MUST only occur once in the document since each section also MUST only occur once.
* *Dates* +
Dates and times MUST be supplied in the ISO 8601 format (“YYYY-MM-DD”, “YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ” respectively).
* *Decimal separator* +
In mzTab files the dot (“.”) MUST be used as decimal separator. Thousand separators MUST NOT be used in mzTab files.
* *Comment lines and empty lines* +
Comment lines can be placed anywhere in an mzTab file. These lines must start with the three-letter code COM and are ignored by most parsers. Empty lines can also occur anywhere in an mzTab file and are ignored.
* *Params* +
mzTab makes use of CV parameters. As mzTab is expected to be used in several experimental environments where parameters might not yet be available for the generated scores etc. all parameters can either report CV parameters or user parameters that only contain a name and a value. +
Parameters are always reported as `[CV label, accession, name, value]`. Any field that is not available MUST be left empty. +
 +
....
[MS, MS:1001477, SpectraST,]
[,,A user parameter, The value]
....

In case, the name of the param contains commas, quotes MUST be added to avoid problems with the parsing: `[label, accession, “first part of the param name, second part of the name”, value]`.
....
[MOD, MOD:00648, "N,O-diacetylated L-serine",]
....

* *Sample IDs* +
To be able to supply metadata specific to each sample, ids in the format `sample[1-n]` are used.
....
MTD sample[1]-species[1] [NCBITaxon, NCBITaxon:9606, Homo sapiens, ]
....
* *Assay IDs* +
To be able to supply metadata specific to each assay, ids in the format `assay[1-n]` are used.
....
MTD assay[1] first assay description
....
* *Study variable IDs* +
To be able to supply metadata specific to each study variable (grouping of assays), ids in the format `study_variable[1-n]` are used.
....
MTD study_variable[1] Group B (spike-in 0.74 fmol/uL)
....
* *URIs* +
URIs MUST follow the format defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8089[RFC 8089] ('file' URIs).
* *Versioning* +
To support a future evolution of the format, an mzTab file MUST report its version. From version 2.0.0-M onwards, we intend to use https://semver.org/[semantic versioning]. This means that increasing the last digit of the version (the _patch_ level) indicates backwards compatible fixes to the specification that require no adaptation of consumers or producers of the format. A change in the middle digit of the version (the _minor_ level) indicates new features that are backwards compatible to existing software but will require updates for new producers and consumers to make use of those features. Finally, a change in the first digit of the version (the _major_ level) indicates breaking changes in the format that require changes in any producing or consuming software to support features of that version.

[[sections]]
=== Sections

mzTab-M files MUST have one Metadata (MTD) section and one Small Molecule (SML) Section. In practice, we expect that most files SHOULD also include one Small Molecule Feature (SMF) section, and one Small Molecule Evidence (SME) Section. Files lacking SMF and SME sections can only present summary data about quantified molecules, without any evidence trail for how those values were derived. It will be left to reading software to determine whether additional validation will be requested such that SMF and SME tables MUST be present.

[[metadata-section]]
=== Metadata Section

The metadata section provides additional information about the dataset(s) reported in the mzTab file. All fields in the metadata section are optional apart from those noted as mandatory. The fields in the metadata section MUST be reported in order of the various fields listed here. The field’s name and value MUST be separated by a tab character:

....
MTD publication [MS, MS:1000879, PubMed identifier, 12345]
....

In the following list of fields any term encapsulated by `\{}` is meant as a variable which MUST be replaced accordingly.

[[small-molecule-section]]
=== Small Molecule Section

The small molecule section is table-based. The small molecule section MUST always come after the metadata section. All table columns MUST be Tab separated. There MUST NOT be any empty cells; missing values MUST be reported using “null” for columns where Is Nullable = “True”.

Each row of the small molecule section is intended to report one final result to be communicated in terms of a molecule that has been quantified. In many cases, this may be the molecule of biological interest, although in some cases, the final result could be a derivatized form as appropriate – although it is desirable for the database identifier(s) to reference to the biological (non-derivatized) form. In general, different adduct forms would generally be reported in the Small Molecule Feature section.

The order of columns MUST follow the order specified below.

All columns are MANDATORY except for “opt_” columns.

[[small-molecule-feature-smf-section]]
=== Small Molecule Feature (SMF) Section

The small molecule feature section is table-based, representing individual MS regions (generally considered to be the elution profile for all isotopomers formed from a single charge state of a molecule), that have been measured/quantified. However, for approaches that quantify individual isotopomers e.g. stable isotope labelling/flux studies, then each SMF row SHOULD represent a single isotopomer.

Different adducts or derivatives and different charge states of individual molecules should be reported as separate SMF rows.

The small molecule feature section MUST always come after the Small Molecule Table. All table columns MUST be Tab separated. There MUST NOT be any empty cells. Missing values MUST be reported using “null”.

The order of columns MUST follow the order specified below.

All columns are MANDATORY except for “opt_” columns.

[[small-molecule-evidence-sme-section]]
=== Small Molecule Evidence (SME) Section

The small molecule evidence section is table-based, representing evidence for identifications of small molecules/features, from database search or any other process used to give putative identifications to molecules. In a typical case, each row represents one result from a single search or intepretation of a piece of evidence e.g. a database search with a fragmentation spectrum. Multiple results from a given input data item (e.g. one fragment spectrum) SHOULD share the same value under evidence_input_id.

The small molecule evidence section MUST always come after the Small Molecule Feature Table. All table columns MUST be Tab separated. There MUST NOT be any empty cells. Missing values MUST be reported using “null”.

The order of columns MUST follow the order specified below.

All columns are MANDATORY except for “opt_” columns.

[[non-supported-use-cases]]
== Non-supported use cases

There are a number of use cases that were discussed during the development process and it was decided that they are not explicitly supported in mzTab version 2.0.0-M. They may be implemented in future versions of the standard.

Examples include:

* Multiplexing technologies
* Including the results from different technologies in one mzTab file e.g. DIMS and LC/MS
* Merging of results from different omics experiments, e.g. proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics


[[conclusions]]
== Conclusions

This document contains the specifications for using the mzTab format to represent results from small molecule pipelines, in the context of a metabolomics or lipidomics investigation. This specification constitutes a proposal for a standard from the Proteomics Standards Initiative and Metabolomics Standards Initiative. These artefacts are currently undergoing the PSI document process, which will result in a standard officially sanctioned by PSI/MSI.
