{"name":"mzTab","tagline":"","body":"## mzTab - _Reporting MS-based Proteomics and Metabolomics Results_\r\n\r\n\r\n## General\r\nmzTab is meant to be a light-weight, tab-delimited file format for proteomics data. The target audience for this format are primarily researchers outside of proteomics. It should be easy to parse and only contain the minimal information required to evaluate the results of a proteomics experiment. One of the goals of this file format is that it, for example, should be possible for a biologist to open such a file in Excel and still be able to \"see\" the data. This format should also become a way to disseminate proteomics results through protocols such as DAS (http://www.biodas.org).\r\n\r\nThe aim of the format is to present the results of a proteomics experiment in a computationally accessible overview. The aim is not to provide the detailed evidence for these results, or allow recreating the process which led to the results. Both of these functions are established through links to more detailed representations in other formats, in particular mzIdentML and mzQuantML.\r\n\r\nWhen you use mzTab format, please cite the following publication:\r\n\r\n  * **[J.

Users can integrate the model into their applications, without the need any other third-party packages. Especially, when users want to recode the model by using other programming languages, and migrates [**jmzTab**](https://github.com/PRIDE-Utilities/jmztab) API into other heterogeneous system.\r\n\r\nWe provide a [tutorial](https://github.com/PRIDE-Utilities/jmztab/wiki/Home) document and a couple of demos to help you to create [metadata](https://github.com/PRIDE-Utilities/jmztab/wiki/jmzTab-Metadata) and [fill data](https://github.com/PRIDE-Utilities/jmztab/wiki/jmzTab-Columns) by calling [**jmzTab**](https://github.com/PRIDE-Utilities/jmztab) API.\r\n\r\nWhen you use jmzTab library, please cite the following publication:\r\n\r\n  * **[Qing-Wei Xu et al., Proteomics 2014; Jun;14(11):1328-32](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.201300560/abstract).
